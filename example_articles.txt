Japanese Gothic Tales:

Japanese Gothic Tales is a collection of stories by the unique Japanese writer Izumi Kyoka, compiled and translated into English by Charles Shiro Inouye, a late associate professor of Japanese at Tufts University. Amidst the vast oeuvre of Kyoka's work, the collection is one of the few available examples that showcase the essence of his preoccupations, writing style, and the literary world that accompanied and sustained him throughout his life. It is also an example of the growing interest from the West in Japanese Literature, possibly due to growing dissatisfactions with the materialistic and positivistic slant of the modern world.

> ### The Four Stories
There are four stories in the book, which range in length from around 10 pages to just under 70 pages:  

* __The Surgery Room__ -  The shortest of the published works. It's themes touch on unfulfilled love, the injustices of social inequality, and to a degree perhaps patriarchal society itself.
* __The Holy Man of Mount Koya__ -  a substantial work that best exemplifies Kyoka's world and the archetypes he returned to again and again.
* __One Day in Spring__ -  the longest of the published works. It is a complex and fragmented story that revolves around dreams, the blurry line between reality and fantasy, love, religion and the link between beauty and tragedy.
* __Osen and Sokichi__- A short story about a doctor who recalls how a prostitute saved him from suicide while poor and adrift.
